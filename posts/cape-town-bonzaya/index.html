      <!-- Scene 1: Hungover Morning - Bright/Hopeful -->
      <section class="scene" data-mood="bright">
        <div class="scene-content">
          <h2>Buying drugs with <span class="redacted"></span></h2>

          <p>It's been eight months since I've seen <span class="redacted"></span> and six weeks since he died.</p>

          <p>I didn't meet <span class="redacted"></span> on purpose. It started with the muffled vibration of my Samsung Pusha FM on my bedside table. The phone is a little blue brick, purchased on arrival to Cape Town for my semester abroad for 200 rand, the equivalent of less than $20. I open one hung-over eye to make out the blurred shape of "Jmpd." People may not forget how to ride bikes, but they do forget how to use T9 keyboards. For me, this means an address book filled with incoherent letter jumbles rather than real names.</p>

          <p>"Hello," I croak.</p>

          <p>The person on the other end, whose name is neither Jmpd or Brian, but for this purpose we'll call Brian, asks what I'm up to and I explain that I slept through my first class, but hope to make it to the second.</p>

          <p>I recline back into bed and slam my head on the pillow. He says something about a dad in town and dinner and I say yes on the basis of free and dinner. He asks me to meet him at his apartment in ten minutes.</p>

          <p>I run some water over myself in the shower, lather my shaven head with far too much shampoo, put on the same clothes as yesterday and scramble down to Main Road in Rondebosch, South Africa, an affluent southern suburb of Cape Town and the home to the University of Cape Town.</p>

          <p>As I near our meeting place I see Brian standing at the corner.</p>

          <p>"Howzit!" I yell, using the local greeting, as if it makes me more culturally aware.</p>

          <p>"Hey man you ready to do this?" he asks, which kind of weirds me out, as I wonder if Brian has daddy issues.</p>

          <p>"I mean, yeah," is what I muster.</p>

          <p>"Buyin' drugs dude. I'm kinda scared, dude."</p>

          <p>At first I laugh and then say "What?" because I actually don't know what he's talking about.</p>

      <!-- Scene 2: The Mission - Neutral/Calm -->
      <section class="scene" data-mood="calm">
        <div class="scene-content">
          <p>Turns out that in my selective hearing, I had tuned out the part where his father's favorite drug is Quaaludes, or Methaqualone if you're a drug nerd. In the 1970s Quaaludes were one of the most popular recreational drugs in America, but the Drug Enforcement Agency cracked down on their production and it's been virtually impossible to get the drug in America for more than two decades.</p>

          <p>But Quaaludes are still widely available in South Africa, where they go by the British name, Mandrax. Our mission was to find and buy as much Mandrax as possible and bring it to Brian's dad. It's a task I hadn't thought I'd ever be asked to do, and not one I was particularly comfortable doing. I also suck at saying no.</p>

          <p>We got in a taxi, rode down Main Road for three towns and hopped out on a street corner outside an auto body shop in Observatory, another suburb known less for its affluence and more for its hipsterdom.</p>

          <p>The small talk is pathetic. Two white Americans standing where we know we're out of place, we discuss the first few days of class. So far so good, although Crime and Deviance in South African Cities does have a lot of Americans, which is frustrating from a cultural immersion standpoint. We're both taking African Instruments, just on different days! The professor seems great.</p>

          <p>After a few sentences of giggling idiocy, silence shows up to force us to address the obvious.</p>

          <p>"Are you nervous dude?" he asks, adding an anxious punch to each of my shoulders.</p>

          <p>"Yeh-nuh-yeah," I come up with. "I mean, yeah. This is scary. We're buying drugs in South Africa."</p>

          <p>Brian explains how it'll be fine, and that this really cool guy he met at a bar is going to help us out. His name is <span class="redacted"></span> and he's a local rap and jazz musician.</p>

          <p>Soon enough a boney-cheeked black man comes sauntering up the hill, a wide smile alleviating the fear of the unknown.</p>

          <p>"<span class="redacted"></span>!" Brian yells as we make our way down to meet the dreadlocked man, our guide in the quest to get an old man high.</p>

          <p>We walk a few blocks down the road and stop at a small house. <span class="redacted"></span> invites us inside, excitedly saying he wants us to meet his roommates. My heart beats a little faster as I enter the house, and hear the security gate close, locking me in the home of the man I met just moments earlier.</p>

          <p>My mind recalls the warnings in my pre-departure reading about staying safe in South Africa — the land of violent crime, where foreigners are targeted, ATMs explode and the AIDS-ridden black man will stop at nothing to rape the white girl.</p>

          <p>We walk around <span class="redacted"></span>'s house and sheepishly greet the housemates. He asks if we want any water and Brian says no. I produce "Nahma uh I'm good."</p>

          <p>"You sure guys?" he asks and we confirm our lack of desire to hydrate.</p>

          <p>"Alright yeah we can go," he says.</p>

          <p>We give the housemates the "nice-to-meet you" routine and we're on our way.</p>

          <p>Brian and <span class="redacted"></span> do the talking while I remain mostly silent, adding a quick sentence here or there to pretend I'm engaged. They mostly discuss music — both play jazz — and how they blend musical styles to create unique sounds. My fear dissipates as <span class="redacted"></span> speaks, his dreadlocks dangling under his fedora, and his permanently adorned smile distorting the angles of his sideburns, which are shaved into large, right triangles.</p>

          <p>Eventually the conversation turns to drugs, as <span class="redacted"></span> cannot contain his laughter, wondering what two white idiots want to do with Mandrax. Brian explains the situation and his father's desire to revisit his favorite drug. He says taking it with his father will be a bonding experience. <span class="redacted"></span> laughs again. "Your dad is into some gangster shit," he says.</p>

          <p>Mandrax in South Africa isn't exactly the same as the drug Leonardo DiCaprio glorified in The Wolf of Wall Street, <span class="redacted"></span> explains.</p>

          <p>He says that to take Mandrax in South Africa, "you crush the pill into powder. You sprinkle that on some dagga, or weed. The worst weed you can find. The worse the better," he laughs, as he appeases us with the American slang "weed" as a substitute for the preferred South African term "dagga." "Then you take a glass bottle and you smash off the end — the neck — and you smoke it through that."</p>

          <p>I'm skeptical of his explanation, as Brian told me you take Quaaludes orally, but I could see this being the difference between American hippies in the 70s and South African "gangster shit." It was really what <span class="redacted"></span> said next that got my attention.</p>

          <p>"Mandrax will knock you out though. A lot of guys will take meth after to pick them back up. That's basically how it works."</p>

          <p>It was at this point that <span class="redacted"></span> asked if we could give him an extra 50 rand so that he could get a "straw" of meth. In Cape Town, meth, colloquially called "tik" because of the physical shaking reaction it causes, is sold in sealed drinking straws for anywhere between 10 and 50 rand, depending on the neighborhood.</p>

          <p>To me, meth is what Walter White sells, not what my new friend wants to buy. But this line of thinking proves just how uninformed many remain about what has recently gained the reputation as the world's most dangerous drug. Brian hands <span class="redacted"></span> a 50 rand bill. And so launched my exposure to the systemic structure of poverty, drugs and gangs that continues to plague Cape Town.</p>

      <!-- Scene 3: Context and Understanding - Neutral -->
      <section class="scene" data-mood="neutral">
        <div class="scene-content">
          <p>Meth is popular not only because it's cheap and easy to produce, but also because it gets you really high. When users smoke or inject meth they receive a euphoric rush, usually accompanied by aggressive behavior. Repeat meth users may find themselves psychologically addicted to the rush, and unable to reproduce such happiness naturally. This psychological phenomenon is caused partly by chemical imbalances. Meth targets and damages dopamine receptors, causing abnormal decreases in a person's ability to naturally find happiness. This dependence leads to a dangerous cycle of meth use where users binge, and can lead to situations where people are awake for weeks at a time, paranoid and aggressive.</p>

          <p>Cape Town has the highest rate of methamphetamine use in the world, a problem stemming from no single issue, but largely steeped in post-apartheid geography and its subsequent socioeconomic creations. Tour guides tell tourists of the strides South Africa has made in the twenty years since the end of apartheid, pointing out the window as they pass townships, speaking of how races are no longer forcibly segregated, and anyone is free to live anywhere. By law, this is true, but in reality, just about nothing has changed.</p>

          <p>Khayelitsha, Cape Town's largest township, remains 99.5 percent black. Gugulethu is also 99 percent black, while coloreds, the word used to describe anyone who's mixed race, of Khoe San heritage or just doesn't fit neatly into black and white, make up 91 percent of Mitchell's Plains' populous. Sure, anyone is allowed to live anywhere, but families with decades of history in an area aren't going to just pick up and move for the sake of moving.</p>

          <p>And then there are the educational and economic barriers. Apartheid rule reserved the best education for the wealthy, which in South Africa means the whites. The World Economic Forum's Global Competitiveness Report for 2014–2015 ranked South Africa's math and science education last of the 148 countries it studied and 146th in terms of overall education. African fact checking organization Africa Check has dismissed these claims, noting that they do not incorporate test scores, but rather rely on subjective evaluation from unnamed "business leaders." Yet Africa Check goes on to cite a 2012 study from the University of Stellenbosch finding only 71 percent of South African sixth graders are literate, and only 58.6 percent numerate.</p>

          <p>Education lays the framework for a child's life, but there are inherent challenges in educating a country with eleven official languages. The apartheid government's insistence on instruction in Afrikaans, an offshoot of Dutch and the official language of South African oppression, led to the 1976 Soweto student protests and the real beginning of the end of apartheid. Now, English serves as the lingua franca of school instruction starting in grade four, essentially forcing the majority of South African children whose first language is not English to learn math, science and history in a foreign language. Considering the language challenge in conjunction with large classes, poor attendance, lack of resources, hunger and all the other hindrances of poverty, it becomes clear escaping township life is nearly impossible.</p>

          <p>Then, if things weren't bad enough, throw in gangs. The average age to join a gang in South Africa is eleven. From an American standpoint this seems preposterous, but consider that only 33 percent of South African children live with both of their parents, according to the SA Institute of Race Relations. Thirty-nine percent live in single mother households, 4 percent in single father households, and the remainder with relatives, in foster care or on their own. Gangs provide the structure the majority of South African families cannot. Gangs have earned the international reputation for ruining lives through violence and drugs — and South African gangs certainly dabble in their fair share of destruction — but those views usually come from the white, privileged, western mind of someone who has someone to call "dad," — someone wanting to condemn violence because violence is bad, but blind to the idea that the kid who pulled the trigger isn't a brainless thug as much as a fly born into a web.</p>

          <p>Drive into any of Cape Town's impoverished areas and children will greet you with both smiles and a gang sign. They may flash the raised thumb of the 26s, the merchants, the raised thumb and index finger of the 27s, the law-keepers, or perhaps the three-fingered salute of the 28s, the warriors. Walk into an elementary school classroom and you'll find American and British flags decorating the chalkboards. These are not to pay homage to South Africa's apartheid admirers, but rather gang emblems. Often, South African children's role models are not mom, dad or the local sports icon, but rather a local gang leader.</p>

          <p>This makes especial sense in the Western Cape, the only South African province under Democratic Alliance (DA), rather than African National Congress (ANC), rule. The DA, and their white, female leader Helen Zille, gains praise for shaping Cape Town into a beautiful bastion of tourism, but those trapped in townships feel forgotten. Gangs and gang leaders provide what the government does not: gangs provide structure, gangs provide parental figures, gangs provide guidance, and gangs provide money. Money brings food and food brings life, the respect of which seems neglected by a government whose promises too often go unfulfilled.</p>

          <p>Gang membership is both a direct result of and a cause of high unemployment rates for South African youth. South African unemployment stands somewhere between 25 and 40 percent, but is higher than 50 percent for colored and black men between ages 18 and 23. This employment struggle comes in part because poor education and high drop out rates leave young men unqualified for skilled jobs, but also because young black and colored men are stereotyped as drug users and dealers. This contributes to a South Africa that has seen income inequality increase since the end of apartheid, as white landowners continue their successes, black political elites use their power to increase personal wealth (doing things like spending 246 million rand of taxpayer money to install a swimming pool and amphitheater at the president's home, supposedly as security measures), but leave the majority struggling to dig out of decades of oppression. In fact, South Africa's Gini coefficient, the measure of a country's income inequality, is the fourth worst in the world according to The World Bank, besting only Namibia, who shared South African apartheid politics until its independence in 1990, and African island nations Comoros and Seychelles.</p>

          <p>But not all methamphetamine, or "tik," users are poor or gangsters. <span class="redacted"></span>, born <span class="redacted"></span>, was part of the burgeoning Cape Town music scene. He started independently, rapping and mixing songs on his computer. He played shows at local clubs and began to make friends in the Cape Town hip hop scene. He later collaborated with local producers and gained followings on Soundcloud, Facebook and Twitter. He was a talented musician and showman who made money through a combination of local gigs and small time drug dealing.</p>

      <!-- Scene 4: Gang Territory - Tense -->
      <section class="scene" data-mood="tense">
        <div class="scene-content">
          <p>Also humble, he didn't share his stories of success as we zigged in and out of streets on our way to Salt River. Our guard is almost completely down now, but that's about to change. As we turn the corner <span class="redacted"></span> smiles again, but this smile is different. "Ok so you guys are going to have to wait outside," he explains, trying to keep us calm. "We're kind of in gangster territory now. I can go in, cause', these guys know me." The words wake my dormant fear, but I also respect his desire to keep us safe.</p>

          <p>I don't know how long he was inside, probably only five minutes, but it feels much longer as Brian and I don't even pretend we want to fill the silence with chatter. We pace around, not wanting to do anything rash, with that whole "gangster territory" thing occupying our minds. We walk down the road, distancing ourselves from where he entered the apartment complex. Eventually <span class="redacted"></span> comes skipping around the corner and down the road, half speed walking, half jogging. He frantically fishes through his pockets and doesn't at all resemble the calm tour guide who'd brought us here. As he nears, he turns and runs back the other way. I don't register any emotion but confusion. He zigzags the street, stopping every now and then to bend and pick things off the ground. After doing this five or six times he comes jogging our way, appearing much more calm.</p>

          <p>Apparently he had dropped the Mandrax as he came down the road, spilling the tablets. He apologizes profusely to Brian, but assures him he found them all. Brian just sort of laughs and says thank you. "We do have a lot of shit," says <span class="redacted"></span>, reminding us we were doing a lot of law breaking and that it's not yet time to celebrate.</p>

      <!-- Scene 5: The Bar - Calm/Relief -->
      <section class="scene" data-mood="calm">
        <div class="scene-content">
          <p>We walked back to Main Road where we will take a taxi right, heading into town to deliver the bounty and to get some dinner. <span class="redacted"></span> will go left, back to Observatory. But first we slip into a dark bar on the corner of Main Road and who knows. Inside I finally feel safe, as if the expedition has ended. I offer to buy a round of drinks. Hot and with my heart still pounding a few beats too fast, I order a Savannah Dry, a local cider. <span class="redacted"></span> and Brian each get Castle Milk Stouts, dark beer universally hated by everyone but <span class="redacted"></span> and Brian.</p>

          <p>A screen above the bar plays the Winter Olympics through a filter of static, the first and only time I'll see the Games shown in Cape Town. We watch a few seconds of the Biathlon. The guy from Norway seems a good shot. We sit at a round table and talk music, Breaking Bad and the weather. As our drinks near the bottom we ask <span class="redacted"></span> when he's playing his next show. February 27 he says. "That's next… Thursday?" I calculate. "I'm not sure," he says. "Yeah it's next Thursday. Let's go to that," I say and Brian agrees. We leave the bar and hail a taxi into town. <span class="redacted"></span> runs across the street to catch a taxi of his own. It's the last time I'll see <span class="redacted"></span>.</p>

          <p>In 2011 there were more than 54,000 recorded deaths in South Africa related to tuberculosis. It is by far the most deadly disease in South Africa, where it's estimated as many as 80 percent of students in the Cape Flats contract latent, or inactive, tuberculosis by the time they graduate high school. About 10 percent of people infected with tuberculosis bacteria will become sick in their lifetime. <span class="redacted"></span> was part of that ten percent.</p>
